![Screen Overview](https://github.com/churchmanlab/Yeast_NETseq_Screen/blob/master/Screen%20Overview.png)

This repository includes the scripts and annotation files needed to analyze NET-seq data generated from *S. cerevisiae*. The directories are listed in order to take raw NET-seq Fastq files through alignment and all analyses presented in the paper in order. There are README files for each analysis step explaining how scripts are run and what is generated with each. 

# Analysis steps
1. Align NET-seq data
2.
