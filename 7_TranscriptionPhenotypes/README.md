# Trends in differentially expressed genes
For those deletion strains with at least 2 replicates, for which differentially expressed genes could be identified, quantifiable transcription features (i.e. antisense : sense transcription ratios, TSS pausing index, and poly(A) pausing index) were split by DE-status of the gene (i.e. differentially up-regulated, differentially down-regulated, or not differentially expressed). The median values of each transcription feature was compared to the ratio of that feature for differentially expressed genes to not differentially expressed genes for each deletion strain. Trend lines were plotted as Gaussian smoothed curves, with boundaries defined by the 95% confidence interval.
