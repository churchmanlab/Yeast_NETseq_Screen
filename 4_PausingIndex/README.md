# Pausing index calculation
Pausing indices were calculated as the length-normalized Pol II density in the region of interest (-50 bp to +150 bp around TSS, ±100 bp around poly(A) sites, and ±10 bp around 5’ and 3’ splice sites) divided by the length-normalized Pol II density in the remainder of the gene.
